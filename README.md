# Fire and Helmet Detection using YOLOv5

## Overview
This project implements **real-time fire detection** and **safety helmet (hardhat) detection** using the YOLOv5 object detection framework.  
The system is designed for **industrial safety and surveillance use-cases**, where early fire detection and helmet compliance monitoring are critical.

The models were **trained separately on Google Colab** using custom datasets and are used here only for inference.

## Tasks Implemented
- 🔥 Fire & smoke detection in video streams
- 🪖 Helmet (hardhat) detection for worker safety
- 📹 Supports both video files and live webcam input
- ⚙️ Modular, CLI-based inference scripts

## Model Weights

⚠️ **Trained model weights are NOT included in this repository.**

- The models were trained **separately on Google Colab**
- Weights are intentionally excluded to keep the repository lightweight

### How to use weights
Download the trained weights and pass them via command line:



```bash
python fire_det.py --weights fire.pt --source fire.mp4
python helmet_det.py --weights helmet.pt --source 0
